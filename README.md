## Introduction
Functional programming promotes a paradigm shift in software development by focusing on writing pure functions that eliminate side effects and mutable state. This approach leads to more predictable and maintainable code, making it easier to reason about program behavior and reducing the likelihood of bugs.

Reactive programming, on the other hand, is pivotal in today's world of event-driven and asynchronous applications. It provides tools and patterns to handle complex asynchronous operations, such as user interactions, network requests, and data streams. This ensures that applications remain responsive and can scale to handle increased workloads without sacrificing performance.


## Lambda and Functional Interface
Explore the concept of lambda expressions and how they are used to implement functional interfaces. Discuss the benefits of using lambdas in writing concise and expressive code.

## Practice with Lambda and Different Signatures
Engage in hands-on exercises to solidify your understanding of lambda expressions and functional interfaces. Practice working with different types of lambda signatures.

## Predefined Functional Interfaces and Practice
Dive deeper into predefined functional interfaces available in Java's standard library. Understand when and how to leverage interfaces like `Predicate`, `Function`, and `Consumer`.

## Method and Constructor Reference
Learn how to reference methods and constructors using the `::` syntax. Understand how method references enhance code readability and reusability.

## Optional for Null Pointer
Explore the `Optional` class as a tool for handling null values effectively, reducing the risk of null pointer exceptions.

## Design Programming in Depth
Delve into design principles and practices in the context of functional programming. Learn about immutability, pure functions, and designing for composability.

## Design Patterns in a Functional Way
Adapt traditional design patterns to a functional programming paradigm. Understand how patterns like Singleton, Strategy, and Decorator can be implemented functionally.

## Streams and Parallel Streams in Depth
Master Java Streams, a cornerstone of functional programming. Learn how to process collections of data in a declarative and parallelizable manner.

## Creating Streams from Custom Sources and Understanding Spliterator Pattern
Create custom data sources for Streams and grasp the concept of Spliterator for efficient parallel processing of data.

## Collectors for Data Processing in Depth
Study advanced uses of collectors for aggregating and processing data from Streams. Explore built-in collectors and their customization.

## Creating Your Own Collectors
Build custom collectors to perform specialized data aggregation operations based on specific requirements.

## Playing with Collections and Maps in Functional Style
Apply functional programming concepts to manipulate collections and maps. Learn to perform filtering, mapping, and reducing operations functionally.

## Data Structures in a Functional Way
Revisit common data structures from a functional perspective. Understand how to create and manipulate data structures while maintaining immutability.

## Reactive Programming: An Introduction
Get introduced to reactive programming and its significance in modern, asynchronous application development.

## Hello RxJava
Begin your journey into reactive programming using RxJava. Set up your environment and write your first reactive code.

## The Observable and the Observers
Understand the core concepts of observables and observers in the context of reactive programming. Learn how to create and subscribe to observables.

## RxJava Operators
Explore a variety of operators provided by RxJava for transforming, filtering, and combining observables to build complex reactive pipelines.

## Combining RxJava 3 Observables
Learn different techniques to combine multiple observables, including merging, concatenating, and zipping.

## Concurrency and Parallelization
Discover how RxJava handles concurrency and parallelization in reactive programs. Understand schedulers and their role in managing asynchronous operations.

## Subjects, Replaying, and Catching in RxJava 3.x
Explore the concept of subjects for multicasting events, replaying observables, and error handling within RxJava 3.x.

## Buffering, Throttling, and Switching
Learn strategies for buffering and throttling events in reactive streams. Understand how to switch between different observables dynamically.

## Flowable and BackPressure - Reactive Stream Implementation
Understand the challenges of backpressure in reactive streams and how Flowable, a part of the Reactive Streams API, addresses these challenges.
